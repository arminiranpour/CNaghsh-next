# RTL & Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] Verify `dir="rtl"` is applied on page shells and key containers.
- [ ] Ensure spacing uses logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-inline`) where directional layout is required.
- [ ] Confirm focus rings remain visible for all interactive elements.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation covers filters, pagination, and cards without traps.
- [ ] Validate color contrast meets [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).
